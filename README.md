# stripe

This is a webapp meant to demonstarate usage of Stripe's API, as well as SMS via Twilio's FaaS.
The focus was on constructing the aspect of a web app that is often left until the end: Payment!
Majority of effort was put into server side development using NodeJS ExpressJS and TypeScript.
Mustache templating engine was used to scafflod the frontend.
